/**
 * The dashboard's one Sync button.
 *
 * Everything here already happens by itself — each module flushes its own
 * outbox when the line returns and refreshes its own cache when opened. The
 * button exists for the moment BEFORE the field: standing somewhere with
 * signal, about to walk into somewhere without, a Field Conductor wants to
 * press one thing and know the phone is loaded — queued work sent up, fresh
 * data pulled down — rather than trust that five modules each did their part
 * at some point.
 *
 * PUSH first, then PULL, so what was recorded offline is on the server
 * before the caches are re-read — a pull first would fetch a picture the
 * phone's own queue is about to change.
 *
 * Dynamic imports throughout: the modules are lazy-loaded chunks (see
 * App.jsx) and a static import here would weld the scanner, PALMS and
 * maintenance into the shell bundle the dashboard ships in.
 *
 * The stamp is only written when EVERY step succeeded — the card shows the
 * last time a sync fully worked, not the last time one was attempted, so
 * the date on it can be trusted the way it reads.

 * whole tables from the server and belongs behind the button, not on a
