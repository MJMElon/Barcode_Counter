/**
 * The company's master switches, and how they meet a person's own permission.
 *
 * There are two layers, and they answer different questions:
 *
 *   Worker Portal Manage → System Setting → Portal View & Function
 *       does this company do this at all?     (shared_portal_settings)
 *
 *   Worker Portal Manage → Setting → a person → Edit Access
 *   Worker Portal → Settings → a worker
 *       may THIS person do it?                (their own permissions)
 *
 * OFF BEATS ON. A master switch can only ever take something away — it is a
 * veto, not a grant. Switching Maintenance on for the company does not hand it
 * to anybody who was not already given it; switching it off takes it from
 * everybody, whatever their own row says. That is the whole point of having
 * the switch, and it is why every function below only ever writes `false`.
 *
 * ABSENT MEANS NO VETO. A module or function the company has never touched is
 * simply not being vetoed, so the person's own permission decides. New
 * functions therefore ship working rather than invisible until somebody
 * remembers this screen — the same rule the panel already uses for modules.
 *
 * No imports, so it stays testable in plain node.
 */

/**
 * The portal panel names its modules the way the portal's menu does; the

 * off, so a veto-only master switch means ticking "GPS track record" on the
 * company panel does precisely nothing, for ever, until somebody also ticks
 * it on every person's row. A switch that cannot switch anything on is not a
 * switch.
 *
 * So an explicit ON raises the DEFAULT for everybody: a person who has never

 * the office has explicitly turned it off for stays off. Off beats on; this

 * quietly edited it would be changing what every other screen sees.
 *
 * ── Why the veto is kept BESIDE the permissions and not folded into them ──
 *
 * The obvious thing is to write `{ gps: false }` into scan_actions and let the
 * existing checks do the rest. It is wrong, and quietly:
 *
 * canScan() fails OPEN on a page with no entry at all — that is deliberate,
 * and it is what lets somebody who has never been through the access screen
 * keep the access they had. But it is all-or-nothing per page: the moment an
 * entry EXISTS, every action not named in it reads as off. So writing a single
 * veto into a page nobody had configured turns "everything allowed" into
 * "nothing allowed", and switching off the remark box for the company would
 * have closed Maintenance outright for every person the office had not yet
 * set up by hand.
 *
 * A veto is not a permission. Modelling it as one is what caused that, so it
 * is kept as what it is: a separate list of things that are off no matter what
 * the permissions say. The permission logic is then untouched and keeps
 * failing open exactly as before.
