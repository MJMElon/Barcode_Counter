/*
 * "Who did this work" — the tick list on a Field Conductor's record form.
 *
 * Workers record their own mornings from the 555 Worker Portal, and on a good
 * day a conductor never opens this. It is for the other days: a phone that
 * will not charge, a PIN that will not take, somebody who left theirs at
 * home. The conductor keys the job and ticks whose it was, and the record
 * says Ali did the work while still remembering the conductor wrote it down.
 *
 * Left untouched, nothing is claimed and the record reads as the conductor's
 * own — which is right, because sometimes he did do it himself.
 *
 * Names come from the payroll register, the same roster the Worker Portal
 * signs people in against, so a name ticked here and a name a worker records
 * under themselves are the same string.
