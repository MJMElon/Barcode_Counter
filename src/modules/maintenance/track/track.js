 * A walked track: the maths, with nothing on screen and nothing async.

 * parts of a GPS track are all decisions about which fixes to believe, and
 * those are exactly the parts worth having a test for.
 *
 * A point is [lng, lat, t, acc]:
 *   lng, lat  degrees, six decimals. Longitude FIRST — the same order the
 *             site boundary uses (see scan_system_setting.html, which says the
 *             same thing rather more loudly), and the order GeoJSON wants. Get
 *             it backwards and the track is not obviously wrong, it is just
 *             somewhere in the sea.
 *   t         seconds since the track started. Not a timestamp per point: a
 *             thousand full ISO strings is most of the size of the record.
 *   acc       the phone's own radius in metres, kept so a track can be judged
 *             later rather than only believed.
