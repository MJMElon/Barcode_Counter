/**
 * The four maintenance jobs, drawn.
 *
 * These are words, not pictures. Drawings of the work kept coming out as
 * near-identical smudges once shrunk to icon size — two of the jobs are the
 * same man with the same tank pointed somewhere else, and two happen over the
 * same grass — whereas the words are what the office writes on the schedule
 * and what the Field Conductor says out loud:
 *
 *   pd        P&D
 *   manuring  BAJA
 *   weeding   RUMPUT, with the knife over it
 *   interrow  RUMPUT, with the spray head over it
 *
 * The two rumput jobs share the word on purpose. Both are done to the grass;
 * what separates them is the knife against the spray head, and that is the
 * only thing that differs in the picture.
 *
 * Every word is forced to an exact width with textLength, so a six-letter
 * word and a three-letter one both fill the frame and none of them depends on
 * the metrics of whatever font is loaded. Everything inherits currentColor.

/* Weeding — RUMPUT under the sickle that cuts it.
   A sabit / 镰刀: a hooked blade, not a curved one. Three straight knives and
   a shallow crescent all failed before this. A chef's knife loses its taper
   at 17px and becomes a wedge; a cleaver reads as a flag; and a crescent
   with only a gentle bow reads as a bent stick, because nothing about it
   says the curve is the point.

   A hook does. The blade sweeps 210 degrees, so the shape closes back on
   itself and cannot be read as anything but a hook, and the handle carries
   on along the tangent at the heel rather than being dropped on top of the
   blade — sitting it at the heel put it lying across the inside of the hook.

   The outline is generated rather than drawn by hand: the arc is sampled at
   26 steps with the width tapering from nothing at the tip to full at the
   heel, which is a shape that can be reasoned about in numbers instead of
   guessed at with bezier handles. 26 steps is indistinguishable from 44 at
   the sizes this is read, and 40% less path. */
