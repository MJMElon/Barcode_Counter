 * What to do about a culling rate.

 * The Field Conductor counts pokok inang, the calculator works out where that
 * leaves the rate, and this decides what happens next. Today there are two
 * answers, and more are expected — so they are a LIST OF RULES rather than an
 * if/else: adding a third band is adding an entry here, and nothing in the
 * calculator screen changes.
 *
 * Rules are tried in order and the first match wins, so they may overlap and
 * the specific ones go first. Each one carries everything the case needs, so
 * the screen never has to know what "drone flight" means.
