 * Where PALMS gets its plots and its statuses: the office, not this file.
 *
 * Two things used to be constants in data.js — the 52 plots (B1–B14, U1–U18,
 * N1–N20) and the eleven activities a plot moves through. Adding a plot or
 * renaming a stage therefore meant editing the app and deploying it, which is
 * the wrong shape for something the nursery changes and the office owns.
 *
 * Both already existed on the office side and neither was being read:
 *
 *   plots     shared_plots — the same table Maintenance and the batch picker
 *             read, kept in Seedling Stock Management
 *   statuses  nops_plot_status_stages — kept on Nursery Operation Management
 *             → Life of Plot → Status Stages, with each stage's ideal days
 *
 * Cached on the device, because a Field Conductor standing in a plot with no
 * signal still has to be able to key the day in. Read fails silently and the
 * cache (or, on a phone that has never had signal, the constants) stands.

 * therefore re-reads history against the new order, which is correct for
