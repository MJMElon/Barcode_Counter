/**
 * One walked job: Start, Pause, Resume, Stop — the state, with nothing on
 * screen and nothing async.
 *
 * Kept apart from the row that draws it for the same reason track.js is kept
 * apart from the map: the awkward parts are all decisions about which fixes to
 * believe and what a pause does to a clock, and those are exactly the parts
 * worth having a test for.
 *
 * The maths itself is NOT re-done here. addFix, metresBetween, trackPayload
 * and the four thresholds live in modules/maintenance/track/track.js and are
 * the same ones the FC Portal's full-screen map uses, so a track walked from a
 * task row and a track walked from the record form are the same object with
 * the same rules behind it.
 *
 * ── What a pause is ──
 *
 * A pause stops the track taking fixes. It does not stop the clock, and that
 * is deliberate: `t` on a point is seconds since the track STARTED, so making
 * it skip the paused minutes would put every later point at a time it was not
 * recorded at, and ended_at would say the job finished before it did.
 *
 * The cost is that the first fix after a long pause can be a long way from the
 * last one before it. That is already handled: a step over MAX_STEP_M is not a
 * step, it is the phone changing its mind, and addFix drops it. So a pause
 * leaves a gap in the line rather than a kilometre of false distance — which
 * is the honest drawing of what happened.
