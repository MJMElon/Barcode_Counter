/**
 * The Worker Portal, as a to-do list.
 *
 * A worker signs in and sees the jobs the office asked for in the period they
 * are standing in — plot, work, chemical and dose — and finishes them by
 * swiping. There is no month planner, no nursery to pick, no form to fill in:
 * everything a record needs is already in the schedule, which is what makes
 * "zero typing" possible rather than a slogan.
 *
 * ── Why this is not MaintenanceModule with a flag ──
 *
 * It is the same DATA and the same rules — the same source, the same schedule
 * reader, the same isDone, the same outbox, the same access checks — and none
 * of that is re-implemented here. What differs is the shape of the screen, and
 * those are genuinely different jobs: a Field Conductor plans a month across
 * four weeks and several nurseries, a worker works down today's list. Bolting
 * a second full layout into an eleven-hundred-line component would have made
 * both harder to change than keeping the layouts apart and the rules shared.
 *
 * There is no full form behind this any more, and no way to reach one. It was
 * there for a job nobody scheduled, and it was the FC Portal's month planner
 * wearing this portal's ribbon — a second screen, with a second set of rules,
 * that a worker only ever arrived at by accident. Work that is not on the plan
 * is the office's to add to the plan.
