 * The 555 Worker Portal — the second front door on scan.mjmnursery.com.
 *
 * One app, one build, one domain, two portals:
 *
 *     scan.mjmnursery.com/#/           the FC Portal, blue cover, e-mail login
 *     scan.mjmnursery.com/#/worker     the Worker Portal, green cover, PIN
 *
 * They share the code that is genuinely the same — the cover, the work types,
 * the language switch, the table jobs are written to — and share nothing that
 * only looks the same. In particular they do not share a way in: the FC gate
 * asks Supabase who you are, this one asks the database whose PIN that was.
 *
 * The whole subtree is wrapped in its own provider, so a worker's session and
 * a Field Conductor's can sit on one phone without either noticing the other.
