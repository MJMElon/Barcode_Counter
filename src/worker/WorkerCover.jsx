/*
 * The 555 Worker Portal's front door — the same exercise-book cover as the FC
 * Portal, printed on ochre board. Same masthead, same fields, same button;
 * the stylesheet is literally the same file (components/bookCover.js), so
 * when one cover is redesigned this one is redesigned with it.
 *
 * One field on it, and one field only: the PIN. A Field Conductor signs in
 * with an e-mail address and a password because a Field Conductor has an
 * office account; a worker has a number the office wrote on their row of the
 * Payroll register, and asking them for anything more is asking them for
 * something they were never given.
 *
 * Under it, a way to put yourself ON that register: a name, a PIN of your own
 * choosing, and a photograph — and nothing else, because everything else is
 * the office's to decide. What that makes is a row waiting to be allocated,
 * which can see nothing at all until somebody files it — see
 * RUN_ME_worker_signup.sql in the office repository. The form is the same
 * lines of the same cover rather than a second screen: a worker who taps the
 * wrong one should be able to tap back without losing where they were.
 *
 * ── The photograph ──
 *
 * Optional, and offered because the person the office is about to file is a
 * name on a board otherwise. It lands on the same mjmnpayroll_workers.photo_url
 * the office's own Worker System writes, so a name arriving in "Waiting to be
 * allocated" arrives with a face on it and whoever files them can see who they
 * are filing.
 *
 * It goes up AFTER the registration has been accepted, using the session token
 * that comes back with it — which is what keeps the bucket shut to people who
 * have not registered. So the two can fail separately, and they are reported
 * separately: a photograph that will not upload must not undo a registration
 * that worked, and a worker who took one and is shown only "welcome" would
 * reasonably believe the office has their face.
