/**
 * One job on the list: what to do, where, with what — and the two ways to
 * finish it.
 *
 * ── Swipe left ──
 *
 * The whole row is the target, because a worker is doing this one-handed with
 * a knapsack sprayer in the other, and a button the size of a thumbnail is a
 * button they will miss. Dragging past COMMIT_PX and letting go records the
 * job. Letting go short of it springs back and leaves a green DONE panel
 * standing open, which is itself tappable — a swipe that did not go far enough
 * should not mean starting again, and it must not mean the row silently did
 * nothing.
 *
 * The thumb pulls the PANEL in from the right; the row itself does not move.
 * Sliding the row the way a mail app does took the icon and the plot name off
 * the left edge, which left a green DONE button beside a row that no longer
 * said which job it was about to finish. What the panel covers instead is the
 * row's own buttons, which have nothing to say while it is open anyway.
 *
 * Pointer events, not touch: the same handler then works under a thumb, under
 * a mouse, and under a test, instead of the row being untestable and dead on
 * anything that is not a phone.
 *
 * ── Start / Pause / Stop ──
 *
 * Start walks a GPS track for this job, and puts the phone away with it.
 * Start becomes PAUSE once it is running, because that is the button the thumb
 * is already over; STOP does what the name says AND finishes the job, saving
 * the walk with the record. That is the whole point of having walked it.
 *
 * Start is grey until the phone has a fix good enough to walk from — under
 * ±30 m — and says so on itself, `⌛ ±35 M`. A Start that presses and then
 * refuses is worse than one that says why it cannot; a paragraph explaining
 * it four rows above the button is clutter on a screen meant to be worked
 * down. The button is the honest place for the answer.
 *
 * The map button opens the satellite view — the nursery outline, where the
 * phone is, and the line walked so far, growing as it is walked. It only ever
 * looks: the walk is run from these buttons, and a second Start on the map
 * would be a rival recording of the same job.
 *
 * ── The camera ──
 *
 * A square at the end of the strip, not another full-width button: with a
 * walk running there are already three, and four labelled buttons across a
 * 390px phone is four buttons nobody can hit. It carries a count once there
 * is something on it, and the pictures show as thumbnails under the row so
 * they can be looked at and taken off again — a photo you cannot see is a
 * photo you will take twice.
 *
 * Nothing is uploaded here. The pictures ride along with the job and go up
 * when it is recorded, which is what makes them survive a plot with no
 * signal.
 *
 * The buttons sit in a row across the bottom of the card rather than stacked
 * down its side: three of them stacked made a row taller than a thumb, and a
 * list where four jobs fit on a screen is a list that can be worked down.
